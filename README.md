# Eye of the Medusa
Eye of the Medusa. Horizontal Danmaku game for Windows 8.1. Won the Imagine Cup 2014 German Final Hackathon in the PC category (no, seriously).

Uploaded here to commemorate Eye of the Medusa: Ultimate Frontier's release, an equally questionable hackjob, BUT for Sega Dreamcast.

Just have fun with this one.
